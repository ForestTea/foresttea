## Welcome everyone here, who found this little place. ##

I'm mostly going to share my Discord Bot Maker RawData-s with those who want it. There's no reason keeping them for myself.

But the most important : **For me all of this works. If it's not works for you, then download the latest mods for DBM.**

( Or you probably need to buy the Discord Bot Maker. )
Download the fresh action mods [from here](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbm-network%2Fmods%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Factions)
Download the fresh event mods [from here](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbm-network%2Fmods%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fevents)





**Music commands/event**
1. You need to have the latest mods. ( The actions and events folder. )
2. You need to install the [scrape-yt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrape-yt) module into your bot project folder.
3. In your Discord Bot Maker program, go to the top left and [install FFMPEG](https://i.ibb.co/rFNLxS3/install-FFMPEG.png) and [update Music Libraries](https://i.ibb.co/f2mKX2Y/update-musiclibraries.png).
4. Now you can collect the raw data for the commands, and for the events. ( Don't forget restarting your bot. )

Play command: [play](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/play)
Skip command: [skip](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/skip)
Auto next song event: [NewMusic](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Events/NewMusic)


**Interactions with members**
1. Just go to the [hug](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/hug) and copy raw data, create new command in your DBM, and edit raw data and paste it.
2. You can hug someone if you mention him/her. You want a hug if you want to hug yourself or no one.
3. You can create different interactions easily, just open in the DBM the [Run Script] action, and change the urls.

( Don't forget renaming the embed titles and the command names too. ðŸ˜‰ )
