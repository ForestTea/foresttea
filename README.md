## Welcome everyone here, who found this little place. ##

I'm mostly going to share my Discord Bot Maker RawData-s with those who want it. There's no reason keeping them for myself.

But the most important : **For me all of this works. If it's not works for you, then download the latest mods for DBM.**

( Or you probably need to buy the Discord Bot Maker. )
