## Welcome everyone here, who found this little place. ##

I'm mostly going to share my Discord Bot Maker RawData-s with those who want it. There's no reason keeping them for myself.

But the most important : **For me all of this works. If it's not works for you, then download the latest mods for DBM.**

( Or you probably need to buy the Discord Bot Maker. )




**Music command/actions**
1. You need to have the latest mods. ( The actions and events folder. )
2. You need to install the [scrape-yt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrape-yt) module into your bot project folder.
3. In your Discord Bot Maker program, go to the top right and [install FFMPEG](https://i.ibb.co/rFNLxS3/install-FFMPEG.png) and [update Music Libraries](https://i.ibb.co/f2mKX2Y/update-musiclibraries.png).
4. Now you can collect the raw data for the commands, and for the events. ( Don't forget restarting your bot after the first 3 step. )
