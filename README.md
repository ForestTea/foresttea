## Welcome everyone here, who found this little place. ##

I'm mostly going to share my Discord Bot Maker RawData-s with those who want it. There's no reason keeping them for myself.

But the most important : **For me all of this works. Download the latest mods for DBM, and update your modules too.**

( Or you probably need to buy the Discord Bot Maker. )
Download the fresh action mods [from here](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbm-network%2Fmods%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Factions)
Download the fresh event mods [from here](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbm-network%2Fmods%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fevents)





**Music commands/event**

0. Get this [database](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Events/DatabaseConnect) event, and connect to your database.
1. If you don't know how, then just install the [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) module, and download the [database](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/private.db)
2. As you can see, you need to put this database file inside your [Main Discord Bot Project Folder](https://i.ibb.co/K7Bg98Z/image.png)
3. You need to have the latest mods. ( The actions and events folder. )
4. You need to install the [scrape-yt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrape-yt),[ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core) module into your bot project folder.
5. In your Discord Bot Maker program, go to the top left and [install FFMPEG](https://i.ibb.co/rFNLxS3/install-FFMPEG.png) and [update Music Libraries](https://i.ibb.co/f2mKX2Y/update-musiclibraries.png).
6. Now you can collect the raw data for the commands, and for the events. ( Don't forget restarting your bot. )
7. The play command using a text channel called : *bot_commands* : so create one, or edit that actions.
8. Maybe i'm forgot some module what you need, if that's a problem, just see in the console what module you need, and install it.
9. In case if you find some error with the QUEUE command, or your bot suddently crashed, etc and don't know how to edit database, then use this [fix_queue](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/fix_queue) command. This command deletting everything from the youtube database part.
10. Put one [Welcome] event like this inside your events. [Picture from the event](https://i.ibb.co/T8p92pK/image.png) not hard doing it, so good luck.

Play command: [play](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/play)
Skip command: [skip](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/skip)
Queue command: [queue](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/queue)
Auto next song event: [NewMusic](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Events/NewMusic)
Updating the database queue event: [QueueRefresh](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Events/QueueRefresh)


**Interactions with members**
1. Just go to the [hug](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/hug) and copy raw data, create new command in your DBM, and edit raw data and paste it.
2. You can hug someone if you mention him/her. You want a hug if you want to hug yourself or no one.
3. You can create different interactions easily, just open in the DBM the [Run Script] action, and change the urls.

( Don't forget renaming the embed titles and the command names too. ðŸ˜‰ )


**Simple balance storage**
1. Just get the following raw datas, and use the commands. You probably able to see how it works.
[money](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/money) command is here, you can add money with [money.add](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/money.add), and remove money with [money.remove](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/money.remove)

( You can have a [work](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/work) command too. Can use it every 2 hour. )


**Timezone command**
1. You need to install the [spacetime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spacetime) and the [timezone-soft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timezone-soft) modules into your bot project folder.
2. Grab the [time](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/time) command from the folder, get the raw data, and add it to your commands.

( Minimal UTC timezone is UTC-12 and the maximum is UTC+14, you can get the 0 with UTC+0 ) [Picture](https://i.ibb.co/swQdK6K/image.png)

( Or try out this [action](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/actions/current_utc_time_MOD.js) what give you a selected timezone what you choosing [Picture](https://i.ibb.co/5swYQv1/image.png),[Picture](https://i.ibb.co/f9HqQgd/image.png). )


**Simple emoji counter with remaining slots**
1. Get the events, so you can save the emojis differently from still to animated. [EmojiCreated](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Events/EmojiCreated) and [EmojiDeleted](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Events/EmojiDeleted)
2. Get the [command](https://github.com/ForestTea/foresttea/blob/main/Commands/emojis) what list your emojis numbers with the remaining slots, differently with the server levels.

( You need to create a command for add them manually, if already have emojis on the server. Fresh server the best. )
